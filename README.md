Sculpt: Advanced Multi-Omics Modeling for Elucidating Neuronal Architecture. This is an open source project, and any code and push updates will be posted on this project repo. Feel free to use any of the code here, but please cite this Github Project when doing so.

This was done in part with 3D interneuron/neuron image modeling with the work of Google Research and Harvard University.

This project uses instance segmentation along with frame by frame image modeling to create a predicted 3D neuron from multiomics data and SEM visualization.

Other contributors and references will be cited later on.
